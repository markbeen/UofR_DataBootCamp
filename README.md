# UofR_DataBootCamp
VBA Homework (due Aug. 22, 2020):
<ul>
  <li> screen shots showing stock performance for each year </li>
  <li> .bas files corresponding to (a) main code to evaluate stock performance, and (b) secondary code to clear column contents* </li>
  <li> .txt files that include .bas files described in #2 </li>
 </ul>
 
 \* I did not include the VBA script I developed using the alphabet_listing file - the code I wrote for the main file is virtually identical.\
